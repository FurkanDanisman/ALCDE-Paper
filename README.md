## Adjusted Log-Concave Density Estimation (ALCDE)

## Abstract

In some situations, data is collected under systematical and technical constraints due to uncertainty in experimental reports, intermittent measurements, confidentiality, and non-detects. For this reason, it might not be possible to retrieve or receive the data in a conventional format but rather in a grouped form where only the number of occurrences is known within intervals. The challenge is to estimate the density of the underlying ungrouped data based on the observed grouped data with no information regarding the underlying distribution. To overcome this problem, this study introduces an adjusted log-concave density estimation (ALCDE) method for univariate grouped data, aiming to provide a non-parametric approach that does not rely on specific distributional assumptions. The performance of the ALCDE method is evaluated through simulations across various distributions with different sample sizes and grid widths. A human mortality data set was considered as a real-life application example. The results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the ALCDE approach in grouped data analysis, offering a broader range of applications over traditional methods.
